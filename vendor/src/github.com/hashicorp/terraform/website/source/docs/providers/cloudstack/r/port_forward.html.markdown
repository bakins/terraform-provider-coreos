# cloudstack\_port\_forward

Creates port forwards.

## Example Usage

```
resource "cloudstack_port_forward" "default" {
  ipaddress = "192.168.0.1"

  forward {
    protocol = "tcp"
    private_port = 80
    public_port = 8080
    virtual_machine = "server-1"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

    Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `managed` - (Optional) USE WITH CAUTION! If enabled all the port forwards for
    this IP address will be managed by this resource. This means it will delete
    all port forwards that are not in your config! (defaults false)

* `forward` - (Required) Can be specified multiple times. Each forward block supports
    fields documented below.

The `forward` block supports:
